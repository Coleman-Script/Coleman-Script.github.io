We live in a fast-paced world, where time is money and everyone is busy chasing ambitions at work, at school, and everywhere in-between. The need to keep up with our constantly changing world has made way for energy boosting shots, which has become a new trend among people of all ages. College students burning the midnight oil, people working around the clock, and some athletes have all made energy shots the choice to get a quick boost, stay awake, alert, and concentrate as energy shots have fewer calories and less sugar compared to full-size energy drinks. One of the most popular is 5-Hour Energy, but what does it do to our bodies and what is the effect on them?

One of the most important issues is 5-Hour Energy is regulated as a dietary supplement and does not require any United States Food and Drug Administration approval.  As such ingredients are listed, but it is not mandatory to list the amount of each ingredient.

Undoubtedly, caffeine is a major component, but a combination of these shots with tea and coffee results in excess of caffeine in the body. According to 5-Hour Energy, one of its regular shots contains the same amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee (approximately 180 mg), but according to Christine A. Rosenbloom, PhD, RD, LD, CSSD, professor of nutrition at Georgia State University, more than 200-300 mg of caffeine a day is considered excess and should be cut back. Excess caffeine can cause nervousness, nausea, vomiting, rapid heartbeats and high blood pressure, causing the body more harm than the benefits 5-Hour Energy is advertised to provide.

A WebMD study reports some people have started using these shots before exercising to get a quick boost, unaware of the fact that the ingredients increase the body’s heart rate. The purpose of exercise is to increase the heart rate and sustain blood pressure, but exercising with an already increased heart rate can trigger a heart attack, a stroke, or some other kind of cardiac episode, especially if the person might have an unknown underlying heart condition.

Along with caffeine, the other ingredients like taurine, tyrosine, phenylalanine and especially B vitamins are present in large quantities. Brent Bauer, MD, director of Complementary and Integrative Medicine program at The Mayo Clinic, Rochester reports taurine may provide users with some energy benefits, but they will not benefit from the ultra high doses of B Vitamins. 5-Hour Energy has more than 8,000% of the recommended daily intake for B12, which helps to form red blood cells, and 2,000% of the recommended intake of B6, none of which are required to boost energy unless a patient has a Vitamin B deficiency.

Professor of Biology at HCC Coleman College for Health Sciences Chandeshwar Sharma, Ph.D., stated, “Excess of everything is bad and it can alter the homeostatic equilibrium which may lead to some acute health problems.

“One should always prefer natural food over any kind of supplement until and unless advised by a health professional.”

Most of the ingredients found in 5-Hour Energy are contained in food products like apples, avocados, grains, nuts and some are naturally occurring in the body, so it can be easily substituted with food products.

Taking energy shots occasionally to be more alert is generally safe, but using it two to three times a day, or chronically, can be harmful to the body. As Dr. Sharma suggested, anything in excess is detrimental, and a healthy diet, rest, and sleep can offer the same benefits as an energy shot without the risks.
